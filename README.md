# 🍽️ The Impact of Descriptive Dishes on Food Selection Preferences

This project investigates how the use of **descriptive dish names** on menus influences food choices. Through a randomized controlled experiment, we assess the behavioral impact of naming strategies on consumer decision-making — combining A/B testing, regression analysis, and causal inference methods.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To evaluate whether adding descriptive names to menu items influences the likelihood of those dishes being selected, accounting for hunger levels and demographics.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Design**: Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) with 231 participants split into treatment and control groups  
- **Tool**: Qualtrics survey with 11 randomized menu cards  
- **Treatment**: 1 descriptive dish per card in the treatment group  
- **Control**: Neutral naming for all items  
- **Covariate**: Hunger levels (scale 1–5)

---

## 📊 Key Analyses

### ✅ A/B Testing & Regression:
- Descriptive names significantly increased selection probability  
- R² = 0.29 showing a strong explanatory power of the treatment variable  
- Hunger level had **no statistically significant effect**

### 🔎 Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE):
- **Age 24+ group** showed the highest increase in descriptive dish selection  
- Younger participants (18–23) also responded positively but less so

### 📈 Power Analysis:
- Effect size: **Cohen’s d = 1.11**  
- Power: **1.00** (indicating strong confidence in effect detection)

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python: `pandas`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`  
- Qualtrics (survey distribution)  
- Excel (score computation)  

---

## 📌 Business Implications

- Descriptive names increase engagement, sales, and customer satisfaction  
- Menus can be optimized by selectively enhancing dish descriptions  
- Applicable in **menu engineering**, **restaurant marketing**, and **customer experience (CX)** design

## ✅ Conclusion

Descriptive menu labels have a measurable and significant effect on consumer food selection. This behavioral insight offers restaurants a data-driven strategy to boost appeal and increase dish conversion — with minimal cost and strong impact.
